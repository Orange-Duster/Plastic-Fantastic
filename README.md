# Plastic-Fantastic
Hi, my name is Marcel, and this is the rocket I designed for my 7-8th grade elective's bottle rocket competition.

Plastic Fantastic is the bottle rocket I designed for the sole purpose of becoming the highest-flying bottle rocket in the elective's history, and it succeeded with an altitude of roughly 205ft (backed by estimates from multiple teachers as well as an Estes altimeter), blowing most competing rockets out of the water (most competing rockets went to altitudes around 90ft or below with the same air pressure and water). Comprised of mostly 3D printed parts (only key not 3D printed parts were the nozzle, bottle, tape, and parachute), this rocket was more durable, aerodynamic, and smaller than all other rockets.

# Materials
- One spool of 98a TPU (98a seems like almost the perfect toughness. That being said, 98a TPU is the only TPU I have, and I'm confident 95a will do well)
- One spool of a hard plastic (ABS, PLA, PETG, LW-PLA, etc. I used a combination of PLA and polymaker pre-foamed LW-PLA, but anything works)
- 4 m3 4.6x4 heat set inserts (completely optional, you can just use tape)
- 4 m3x12 bolts (again, optional. Just use tape)
- 10ish 38mm OD 3mm thick washers (optional. These are for weight if you don't have enough in the nosecone. Just take out the parachute and pop them in. You can also use rocks, or, preferably, having a medium-high infill when printing the nosecone)
- Altimeter (It's optional, but it's pretty nice to know altitude. Estes or Jolly Logic. Estes is cheaper, but MUCH more unreliable. It's optional, but it's pretty nice to know altitude. If this is a school project, convince your school to buy a Jolly Logic Altimeter)
- Duct tape 
- String
- Trash Bag (any plastic bag works, but LDPE (think grocery store bag) and trash bags work the best)
- 2L bottle (I used a ginger ale bottle as it was the closest bottle to the generic 2L bottle design I used)
- USPS labels (they're essentially free stickers. Perfect for decorating the rocket!)

# Printing Instructions
All parts aside from the wings should be printed without supports. For any TPU part printed for the nosecone, give it 2-3 perimeters/walls, as well as >30% infill. I don't know what percentage of infill you'll want, but it's definitely more than 10%. For the wings, use the place on face tool in prusaslicer to place it down in an orientation where only the part which touches the fuselage/bottle needs supports. Print the wings with around 10% infill and 2-3 perimeters. I used LW-PLA for the wings.

# Assembly Instructions
Take your 2L bottle and take off the wrapper/skin. This just makes it look better, especially if you put stickers on the rocket. Then tape the nosecone base onto the bottom of the bottle (like, the end without the neck). Then, put the aligner onto the neck, and with another person, stick all the fins on and tape them down. They should mostly conform to the body, with only a few gaps. The gaps should be in the middle and back of the fin, not the front. Pull off the aligner. You won't need it anymore, but dont throw it out. If something happens to the fins right before launch, you might need it. Note that the 3 fin aligner is a lot more forgiving than the 4 fin alinger when there is duct tape attached to the fins, so you might need to scale the 4 fin aligner up a bit in the slicer. You can also try to use hot glue for the fins, but I found it too weak. Bolt/tape the nosecone tip to the nosecone body. Cut a parachute around 200mm in diameter, then punch 6 holes in it for string to go through. Cut 7 pieces of 70mm long string, and stick 6 through the 6 holes in the parachute. Tape them to the parachute. Then, take the parachute holder and stick the 7th string through the 2 middle holes and tape the ends of each string (the ends NOT on the parachute or holder) together. Now, take a tiny piece of duct tape (masking tape is better) and make a small tape loop. Now, stick it onto the nosecone body and then stick your finger on it a few times to make it less sticky. Now, on the launchpad, take your altimeter and put it into the nosecone body, then tape/bolt it down with the parachute holder, fold the parachute (optional) and then put it into the parachute/weight holder. Then, stick the nosecone body onto the base and you’re ready to fly! Another (and my favorite) way of launching is to take the altimeter, put it in, put tape over it so it’s secure, put weights where the parachute should be (only if you need them to fly straight), put the nosecone body on the base, then tape the whole thing shut. Now you can launch. It essentially turns the rocket into a massive lawn dart, and it can shove itself deep into dirt. It’s also the best for stability (at least for me, as mine needed more weight).
